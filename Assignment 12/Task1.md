### Task 1
---
Starter Code: unit6_task1_starter.py download

Use the starter code and change the name to task1.py. Fill in the blanks as indicated with `<Fill In>`. You should only fill in a single line of code. DO NOT change any other code. Note that your code will replace that entire marker including < and >.  You will print out three lists. Each list must be based on the baseList.

* list1 will contain all even valued numbers in baseList
* list2 will contain values from baseList that are multiples of 3 and less than 50
* list3 will contain values that are 10 times greater than the numbers from baseList that are multiples of 5 and greater than 50

Sample output. Note the ... is filler because the actual list is long

    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, ... , 96, 98, 100]
    [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48]
    [550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000]

**Note: No software dev plan or UML required**
