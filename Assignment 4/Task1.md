Save program in a file called task1.py and the plan in a file called plan1.txt. Calculate the area of a regular polygon. A regular polygon is one in which all sides are the same length and the angles all have the same degree. The formula for the area of a regular polygon is

![AreaFormula](https://pi998nv7pc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production/svg?tex=Area%3D%5Cfrac%7Bn%5Ctimes%20s%5E2%7D%7B4%5Ctimes%5Ctan%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright)%7D) 

where n is the number of sides and s is the length of each side. Prompt the user for the length and number of sides and display the result, with an appropriate message, to the user.

You must use the math modules for pi, tan(), and pow(). You must use different techniques for importing in order to use items from the module exactly as follows (with the appropriate parameters) in your code:

    tan()
    math.pow()
    pi

Output should be rounded to 5 decimal places using the round() function.
