Requirement Specification
    The user will enter the number of rows to have in a pyramid of numbers.
    Based on the user's input the program will display a pyramid where each row contains the number x,
    which is printed x times, where x is the row number. There is a space between each number on the rows.
    The top row's value is always 1, and the bottom row's value is the number given from the user.
    Each row is centered in a space equal to the length of the bottom row.

    main function()
        1. user enter a number
        2. call makeNumberPyramid(userInput) and output it to variable
        3. print output variable
