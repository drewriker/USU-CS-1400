# Task 1 - Dr. Moody
Starter code: [task1_starter.zip](https://github.com/drewriker/USU-CS-1400/files/6283277/task1_starter.zip) (make sure to change the name to task1.py).

You will not make a UML diagram or Software Design Plan for this task.

See the demo video for this assignment. Use the provided code file to complete the task to match the video. Use the starter code provided. Note that the class is defined in the same file as the main function. This is for convenience and you may leave it that way. No import statement is needed. You must ***fill in the blanks ( `<Fill-In>` ), as well as add any other methods or data*** that is needed. All blanks should be completed with a single line of code (or partial line). You should NOT modify any other code that exists. I repeat, you should NOT modify any other code. If you have any questions about this, the answer is, "No, you may not modify any existing code." Only remove the blanks and add other missing methods.

Use a radius of 100 for the head. The mouth is a thicker line. The face is centered at 0, 0.

### Common Errors
---
The #1 problem on this assignment is not using the information that has been bolded above. Make sure to review ***conditional expressions***, and add any methods. You may not modify the code other than the **`<Fill-In>`** sections, but there are some methods that you have to add. Read the starter code and it should be obvious what they are.
