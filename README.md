# USU CS-1400
Python code for Computer Science 1400

### Details
All python assignments for Computer Science 1400 at Utah State University

Each weeks assignment will at least have the assignment title and hopefully the description 
It will then have the python code I used to solve the problem.

All of my assignments are coded by me, Drew, and have not been plagiarized by other creaters.

### Usage
I recommend you don't copy exactly what I coded because your professor will likely know.

Instead, use my code as a template for yours.



### Be smart
Please be smart with the code I provide. 
Thank you!
