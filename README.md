# USU CS-1400
Python code for Computer Science 1400


### Details
---
All python assignments for Computer Science 1400 at Utah State University

Each weeks assignment will be put into folders, named respectively, and have the description and requirements for the assignment.

It will then have the python code I used to solve the problem.

All of the assignments are coded by me, Drew, and have not been plagiarized by other creaters.


### Usage
---
I do **NOT** recommend copying what I have programmed because your professor will likely know.

Instead, use my code as a template for yours.



### Be smart
---
Please be smart with the code I provide. 
Thank you!
